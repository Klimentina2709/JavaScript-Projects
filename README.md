A simple Study Timer web application built with HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript. This project is designed to help users manage their study sessions and breaks effectively. It features the ability to set study and break times, which are saved in local storage. When the timer expires, an alert is displayed, and a progress bar visually represents the remaining time. This project was created as a learning exercise to practice JavaScript and enhance user experience through timers and local storage.
