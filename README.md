# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! This collection features a variety of practice applications primarily built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The focus of these projects is to enhance my skills in front-end development, specifically in creating CRUD applications, managing timers with `setInterval`, dynamically creating elements, and manipulating the DOM.

## Projects Overview

This repository includes several projects that demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript and its applications in web development:

1. **[Study_Timer](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/JavaScript-Projects/tree/Study_Timer)**: A timer application for managing study sessions.

- A timer application that helps users manage their study sessions and breaks. It features progress bars, alerts, and local storage for saving user preferences.

2. **[Expense_Tracker](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/JavaScript-Projects/tree/Expense_Tracker)**: A CRUD application for tracking and managing expenses.

- A CRUD application for tracking expenses. Users can add, delete, update, sort, and filter expenses, allowing for efficient financial management.

3. **[Book_List](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/JavaScript-Projects/tree/Book_List)**: A book management app for adding and filtering books.

- An application for adding and filtering books using constructors. It provides a learning experience in object-oriented programming and DOM manipulation.

4. - **[Task_Manager](https://github.com/Klimentina2709/JavaScript-Projects/tree/Task_Manager)**: A task management application to add, complete, and delete tasks.

- A simple task management app that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It helps in understanding task tracking and DOM updates.

## Learning Objectives

Through these projects, I aimed to:

- Master CRUD operations in JavaScript applications.
- Implement timers and intervals effectively using `setInterval`.
- Dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements.
- Enhance my overall understanding of front-end development practices.
